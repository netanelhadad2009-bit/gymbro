# Note: test_auth.sh JWT token
# The current working tree version of test_auth.sh is clean (uses env var).
# However, one JWT exists in git history (commit 9f59a29ba) which would require
# git-filter-repo to remove. Since we're avoiding history rewrites this pass,
# this historical finding is documented here.
# To fully clean: run git-filter-repo to scrub the history.
